# Ease of Living Index Calculator

## Project Overview
The Ease of Living Index (EoL) Calculator is a web-based application that allows users to:
- Predict the Ease of Living Index based on user-provided parameters such as healthcare index, education index, safety index, climate index, and purchasing power index.
- Analyze whether a location is suitable for living based on the predicted score.

This application uses machine learning to train a model on a dataset and deploys a frontend using Flask to accept user inputs and display results.
